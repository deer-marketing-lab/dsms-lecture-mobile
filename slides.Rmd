# What is Mobile Marketing?

**Mobile Marketing**: Any promotional activity that takes place on smartphones and other handheld devices such as tablets

Examples include: 

* Apps
* Push notifications / In-app messaging
* Personalization 

... i.e. it's more than *mobile advertising*

App creators care a lot about **customer retention**

# What are the impacts of app creation on product adoption and purchase behaviour?

---
class: font140
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: Does the introduction of a mobile app increase consumer spending?

* The focus: in "highly competitive" industries

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Think about when you have downloaded a new app from a company, how does it effect: 

* How much you search for products from that company? From competitors?
* How much you spend on products from that company? From competitors?
* Do you download competing firms apps too?
* Are the changes in behaviour persistent over time?

---
class: font140
# Motivation 

**Strategic Question**: Does the introduction of a mobile app increase consumer spending?

* The focus: in "highly competitive" industries

Why Relevant?

* Competitive Industries (may) feature:
  * Lots of consumer search 
  * Infrequent purchase from a given brand
  * Lots of competing apps

**Data driven approach**:

* "Natural Experiment": Introduction of a Mobile App 
  * Background issue: downloading an app is not random assignment
* Industry: Hotels 

---

# Not the first paper in this space ...


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/adoption_litreview.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Why **this** paper (in the authors mind)?

* Competitive industry
* Consumer search / research is a dominant feature

---
class: font140
# The Experiment 

**Outcome Variable**: Spending

**Treatment**: Adoption (download) of the app

* Which is not randomly assigned ...
  * They try to deal with this via fancier tweaks to method
* Six cohorts of adopters 
  * 10K users from each cohort included in sample

**Control Group** : Users who have not yet adopted the app 

  * We're going to see many cross cohort comparisons
  * But not the "next nearest" cohort

**Analysis**: Difference in Differences

---
class: font140
# Cohort Comparisons

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/adoption_cohort_comparisons.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Approach is (binary) **cross cohort comparisons** 

Why **not** just have **one control group**?

* Control group would **change in composition over time** 
* Recent work on Diff in Diff finds this **causes problems**

Does **not** include **nearest cohort** of adopters 

* Because they might have **different behaviour near adoption** 

---
# Graphical Evidence

# Main Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="85%"}
url <- "figs/adoption_main_results.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

---
class: font150
# Main Results - Summary

We'll focus on the **DID results** ... 

* **Spending across all channels declines** by more than **10% after adoption** 
* **Stronger** decline for **Third-Party Channels** than Direct

Remark:

* Other estimates (DID Heckman and DID-Matching) try to handle the non-random adoption 
* We'll not worry about those

# Is it due to bad app quality? 

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/adoption_searches.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
]

.pull-right[
**Bad quality app** $\rightarrow$ 

* Consumers wouldn't use it
* Usage likely declines after adoption 

There's **no evidence** of that here...

* Usage seems to stay constant / increase over time 
* For searches
* (What about other variables?)

]

---
class: font150
# Is it due to Competition?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/adoption_competition.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[**Spending decline is stronger when more apps on the market**] 

Why? 

* More competition
* Consumers search around 
* ... On other apps too

---
class: font160
# Takeaways

**Before this paper**, we believed 

* Mobile **apps make it easier for customers to engage directly with a firm's product** 
  * Suggests that might increase spending and retention

But findings suggest this **might not always be the case**

* In a highly competitive market (hotels) that does not lead to more spending 
  * Consumer's **use the app to search** 
  * But do so for competing firms too 
  * Likely **finding the best deal for them** 
  * Which is **not always the focal firm** ... so spending declines

# Is there value in targeting consumers based on app use in real time?

---
class: font150
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: Does Real Time Targeting lead to more consumer engagement with the firm?

* Real Time Targeting: (Personalized) Messages delivered based on specific actions 

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Suppose you are on Zalando app browsing for pair of shoes and you are sent a real time promotion: 

* Would you respond differently if the promotion is sent when you are on a "search page" vs a "product page"? why?
* Does the type of promotion, i.e. discount vs loyalty points matter? Why?
* How does this kind of promotion make you feel?

---
class: font150
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: Does Real Time Targeting lead to more consumer engagement with the firm?

Why Relevant?

* Mobile tracking is ubiquitous 
* Might facilitate purchases now and in future, vs 
* Consumers can feel targeted promotions have a "creep" factor

**Data driven approach**:

* Field Experiment at large Japanese Fashion Retailer
* A/B Test style Regressions
  * (with controls ... which may be an issue statistically)

---
class: font150
# Experiment

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_expdesign.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

**Sample**: approx 16,500 users, year: 2017

**Incentives**: (avg expenditure is 20USD)

* Low: 200 points roughly 2 USD cash value 
* High: 500 points roughly 5 USD cash value

---
class: font150
# RTT and Current Shopping 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_current.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

Findings: 

* RTT not effective in early stage 
* RTT effective in Late Stage 
  * 12.1% increase in visits
  * 32% increase in products purchased

---
class: font150
# Early Stage RTT and Future Shopping 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_future_early.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[**Low and High in early stage both improve KPIs in the next 30 days**]

* High incentives more effective
  * Note: 2000 JPY approx 13.50 USD

---
class: font150
# Late Stage RTT and Future Shopping 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_future_late.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[**Similar effect between early and late stage targeting over 30 day period**]

* How do we see this? 95% Confidence intervals overlap

---
class: font150
# Prior Purchase and Late Stage RTT

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_attenuate_late.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[**Prior purchase history decreases effectivess of late state RTT**]

* Remark: Unclear how they define prior purchases...

---
class: font150
# Prior Purchase and Early Stage RTT


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
url <- "figs/rtt_amplify_early.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[**Prior purchase history amplifies effectivess of late state RTT**]

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

**Findings**:

* Targeting on mobile apps has causal (positive!) impacts on consumer's purchase behaviour 

* Prior purchases attenuate RTT effectiveness of late stage promotion ...
  * ... Authors argue this is due to privacy concerns 

* Prior purchases amplify RTT effectiveness of early stage promotion

**Implications**: 

* RTT on mobile works, is effective, has positive ROI
* Care might be needed when targeting in late stages of purchases if consumers are concerned about privacy

# Should a firm release both free and paid version of an app?


---
class: font150
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: When is offering a free version of an app alongside a paid version effective?

`r icons::fontawesome("question", style = "solid")` Think about browsing for a new app, and you find both a free version of an app and a paid version: 

* Which will you download first? Why?
* Suppose you download the free version first, when will you switch to the paid app?



---
class: font150
# Motivation

**Strategic Question**: When is offering a free version of an app alongside a paid version effective?

Why Relevant?

* Freemium is a prevalent pricing model for mobile apps
* Tradeoff between letting consumers sample and cannibalizing demand 
  * Unclear which effect might dominate

**Data driven approach**:

* Apps on the App Store 
* Natural Experiment: Launch of free version

---
class: font130
# Experiment

**Sample**: Games on App Store September 2011 to October 2013 

* 2,531 games launched over this period where free launched after paid
* Focus on 4 weeks around launch of free version

**Outcome** Variable: 
  * Ideal: Downloads, but unavailable
  * Actual: Number of Ratings

**Treatment**: Free Version Launch 


**Treatment Group**: Apps who have a free version launched

**Control Group**: Paid apps that ...

1. Same Genre as Freemium App 
2. Control not developed by same developer
3. Time between launches less than 6 months 
4. Similar Update strategies

.center[**Smaller effected in crowded markets**]

Remark: focus is free then paid 

* To minimize role of sampling

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
url <- "figs/freemium_sampling_vs_discovery.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

.center[
**Sampling Effect dominates** 
]

---
class: font150
# Takeaways

* **Freemium** is a **dominant strategy** in digital markets 

* Findings suggest **free version leads to higher demand for paid** 
  * Rather than cannibalization 

* Mechanisms at work: **Sampling** and **Product Discovery**

Implications: 

* Freemium can increase demand for paid versions

# Recap

---
class: font150
# Summary

* In **competitive markets** consumers who **adopt a firm's app** may **not purchase more** from them 
  * Decreases search costs, but competiting firms may have better deals 

* **Real Time Targeting** within an app is **effective** way to **increase current & future purchases** 
  * Though timing of discounts for experienced consumers could be sensitive 

* **Spillover effects** rather than cannibalization of **demand** between **free and paid** version of apps 
  * Workds via consumer sampling and product discovery
